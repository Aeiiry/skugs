    """Generates a suitable file name for writing output.

    Often tools will want to take a file, do some kind of transformation to it,
    and write it out again. This function determines an appropriate name for the
    output file, through one or more of the following steps:

    - changing the output directory
    - appending suffix before file extension
    - replacing the file extension
    - suffixing the filename with a number (``#1``, ``#2``, etc.) to avoid
      overwriting an existing file.

    Args:
        input: Name of input file.
        outputDir: Optionally, a new directory to write the file into.
        suffix: Optionally, a string suffix is appended to file name before
            the extension.
        extension: Optionally, a replacement for the current file extension.
        overWrite: Overwriting an existing file is permitted if true; if false
            and the proposed filename exists, a new name will be generated by
            adding an appropriate number suffix.

    Returns:
        str: Suitable output filename

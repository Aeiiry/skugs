Define all configuration options that can affect the working of fontTools
modules. E.g. optimization levels of varLib IUP, otlLib GPOS compression level,
etc. If this file gets too big, split it into smaller files per-module.

An instance of the Config class can be attached to a TTFont object, so that
the various modules can access their configuration options from it.

Interface to the Adobe Glyph List

This module exists to convert glyph names from the Adobe Glyph List
to their Unicode equivalents. Example usage:

	>>> from fontTools.agl import toUnicode
	>>> toUnicode("nahiragana")
	'な'

It also contains two dictionaries, ``UV2AGL`` and ``AGL2UV``, which map from
Unicode codepoints to AGL names and vice versa:

	>>> import fontTools
	>>> fontTools.agl.UV2AGL[ord("?")]
	'question'
	>>> fontTools.agl.AGL2UV["wcircumflex"]
	373

This is used by fontTools when it has to construct glyph names for a font which
doesn't include any (e.g. format 3.0 post tables).
